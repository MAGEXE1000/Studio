| [global-engineering-workflow.md](global-engineering-workflow.md) | The 12-step mandatory workflow for every task     |
| [architectural-invariant.md](architectural-invariant.md)         | Shared-first development rule and system registry |

## Rules

- Every task must follow the [Global Engineering Workflow](global-engineering-workflow.md). No steps may be skipped.
- Before implementing any feature, check the [Architectural Invariant](architectural-invariant.md) to determine if it belongs to a shared system.
- When a new workflow is discovered or refined, add it to this directory.
- These documents are permanent and must survive between chats, releases, and contributors.
